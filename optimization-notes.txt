Making all of the RBRTrees exist in contiguous memory:
  . reduced time by 3 seconds on a 100x100x100 grid.

Abstract
Introduction
  . Median fiter is useful.
  . Median filter is inefficient.
  . Time complexity of naive algorithm
  . Use of histograms.
  . Time complexity tradeoff, bitdepth vs radius.
  . Huang's algorithm.
  . Perreault's algorithm.
The Algorithm
  . Similar to Perreault's algorithm, but works with higher bit depths.
  . We use the same space-traversal strategy that Perreault uses, but
    with trees.
  . Fact: the median of many sorted lists can be found efficiently.
    - Proof.
  . Initialize median filter (show diagram)
  . Traversal/wrapping strategy
  * Optimization: wrapping of indices
  * Median calculation algorithm.
    1. Find the medians of each of the RBRTrees in lg(n) time.
    2. Algorithm to find median.
